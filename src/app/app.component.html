  <!-- 
    TO DO:
    3) make equal axes fit the data:
      3.1) make axes' lengths equal to what is needed to contain the data
      3.2) make the chart occupy the whole window
    4) add axis names
    5) make lines colored as per spectrum
    6) add legend and series names and chart name
    7) make series and legend highlight on hover if more than one
    8) make the control that you draw on and it regulates lines' opacity
    9] make it show mouse cursor x and y values on the axes
    10] make it show dotted lines from those points on axes to the cursor
    11] make those values and lines persist on click
    12] make the chart draggable with its title, not only the header
