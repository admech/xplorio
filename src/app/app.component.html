  <!-- 
    TO DO:
    6) add legend and series names and chart name
    7) make series and legend highlight on hover if more than one
    8) make axes labels show proper values, not 0..1
    9) make the control that you draw on and it regulates lines' opacity
    10) make a switch equal vs simple axes
    nice to have:
      1) make it show mouse cursor x and y values on the axes
      2) make it show dotted lines from those points on axes to the cursor
      3) make those values and lines persist on click
      4) make the chart draggable with its title, not only the header
      5) make the chart resize so that its margins are always the same
